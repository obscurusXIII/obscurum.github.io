I'm Pedram. Online, I'm mostly known as ObscurusXIII, Obscurus ab Persia, or simply Obscurus.
I've used many pseudonyms online as an effort to stay private and therefore secure as possible. To this end, I familiarized myself with various technologies. While I don't necessarily feel I've wasted time by following draconian OPSEC, I've been long since blackpilled on privacy. Those who know me won't find me doxxing myself online; however, I've become much more open in the cyberspace.
I will publish my art, poems, etc. music here. I won't shy from writing analytical essays and sometimes redpilling my audience with some _BASED_ takes. Those who wish to peer into my mind more intimately (why?) can visit my Telegram channel at https://t.me/kamippoi.
