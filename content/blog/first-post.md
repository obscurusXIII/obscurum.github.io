Happy Noruz (Yes, not Nowruz). These are trying times for my brothers and sisters in Iran. Sometimes it feels like everything is on fire around us, and there is the lil ol' me occupying myself with leeth and letter while my homeland burns down, but life goes on...

Speaking of leethcraft (poetry), one of my personal goals is to finally finish reading Perrine. In Perrine, there are these sections for analytical writing on poetry, god willing, I plan to post one such writing a week.
